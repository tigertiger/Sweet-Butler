<h3 style="padding:1em 0 1em 0">December 3rd</h3>

* Read about Trello tech stack
  * <em>TD: Check out Vue.js?</em>
* Create Trello board & populate with to do's
* Start basic static react app creation so I have something to think about
* Read & watch React tutorials on various grob:
  * https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-navbar-react/
  * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-responsive-navbar-using-reactjs/
  * https://www.skillshare.com/classes/The-Complete-React-Bootcamp-2021-w-React-Hooks-Firebase/895676015
    * Completed lessons 35 through 55 of the class above; solidified some react knowledge; learned about hooks a bit; got some solid ideas about file setup, conditional rendering, styling [dynamic classes, etc.]

<h3 style="padding:1em 0 1em 0">December 8th</h3>

* Explore MUI components [12:10pm-12:40pm]
* Began creating App Diagram [12:40pm to 12:55pm]

<h3 style="padding:1em 0 1em 0">December 9th</h3>

* Watched/followed along with lessons 58 through 60 of https://www.skillshare.com/classes/The-Complete-React-Bootcamp-2021-w-React-Hooks-Firebase/895676015 [1:05pm - 2pm]
  * Hoping to gain a stronger understanding of multi-layout react sites & search functionality
* Spent some time troubleshooting VS Code shortcuts and extensions >[ [2pm - 2:21pm]
* Headache break. Sigh.
* Back to the bootcamp: lessons 61 through 65 [2:33pm - 4:05pm]
  * Learned a cool, scalable way to do a nav bar with an array
  * Learned how to structure search queries and display results [also work with APIs in that context, though I don't think I'll need that for this project]

<em>End of day thoughts: Would like to finish following along with the box office tutorial section [through lesson 82], but also would like to actually get something bigger than what I have "down on paper," so...goals for tomorrow...are?
- Create very basic app with input and queries and display?
- Play around and see if Firebase will adequately work for this project or if I need a different database/hosting option
- Watch as much of that tutorial as I have time for after I feel like my project exists in some way...?

Something like that...</em>

* 4:23 - 4:30pm - Oh, also updated KanBan board. Realized I need to figure out if Firebase is an ok solution for authentication, since I'm planning to use Browser Router and in this week's projects trying to use firebase auth with browser router was a huge nightmare....

<h3 style="padding:1em 0 1em 0">December 10th</h3>

[8:00am - 8:46am]: Started building out basic app
[] : Created Flow document to start describing basic user experience
[8:49am - 10:12am]: Continue basic app build
[10:12am - 12:15pm]: Return to the React Bootcamp lessons. 66 through 72
  * This should all be super useful, unless I run into a lot of trouble translating from using an API into using Firestore... ðŸ¤ž
[1:25pm - 1:45pm]: Did some reading and playing around with styled components, because my tutorial guy was using them. Figured out how to use extended classes & etc. Seems much more useful than I originally thought. Still not entirely convinced. What's really the difference between a styled.js and a styles.css? Blah blah.
[1:55pm - ]: MORE TUTORIAL. WOOooOooOoOoO. ðŸ¥´
